# Day 17 – Network Security Devices

## Objective

Understand the purpose of common network security devices and how they protect networks from cyber threats.

---

# What are Network Security Devices?

Network security devices are hardware or software solutions used to monitor, filter, and protect network traffic.

Their primary goal is to:
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Detect malicious activity.
- Protect sensitive data.
- Maintain network availability.

---

# Firewall

A Firewall is a security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

Think of a firewall as a security guard standing at the entrance of a building.

It decides:
- Who is allowed in.
- Who is blocked.
- What traffic is permitted.

Types of Firewalls:
- Packet Filtering Firewall
- Stateful Firewall
- Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

Benefits:
- Blocks unauthorized access.
- Prevents many network attacks.
- Controls network traffic.

# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity.

Important:
An IDS **only detects and alerts**.

It does **not** stop the attack.

Functions:
- Monitors traffic.
- Detects unusual behavior.
- Generates alerts for administrators.

Example:
An IDS detects repeated failed login attempts and sends an alert.

---

# Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

An IPS is similar to an IDS but can also stop attacks automatically.

Functions:
- Detect suspicious activity.
- Block malicious traffic.
- Prevent attacks in real time.

Think of it this way:

IDS = Alarm System

IPS = Alarm + Security Guard

---

# Proxy Server

A Proxy Server acts as an intermediary between users and the Internet.

Benefits:
- Hides users' IP addresses.
- Filters malicious websites.
- Improves performance through caching.
- Enforces company Internet policies.

---

# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between a user and a remote network.

Benefits:
- Protects sensitive information.
- Secures remote workers.
- Encrypts data over public Wi-Fi.

---

# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A Web Application Firewall protects web applications from attacks.

It filters HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

Protects against:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- File Inclusion attacks

Unlike a traditional firewall, a WAF focuses specifically on web applications.

---

# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

A SIEM collects and analyzes logs from multiple devices.

Functions:
- Centralized logging.
- Threat detection.
- Incident investigation.
- Alert generation.

Common SIEM solutions:
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Splunk
- IBM QRadar

---

# Comparing Security Devices

Firewall
- Filters traffic.

IDS
- Detects attacks.

IPS
- Detects and blocks attacks.

VPN
- Encrypts communication.

Proxy
- Acts as an intermediary.

WAF
- Protects web applications.

SIEM
- Collects and analyzes logs.

---

# Why Network Security Devices Matter

Organizations use multiple security devices together.

Example:

Internet

↓

Firewall

↓

IPS

↓

Switch

↓

Users

↓

SIEM collects logs from every device.

This layered approach is called **Defense in Depth**.

# Key Takeaways

- Firewalls filter network traffic.
- IDS detects attacks but does not stop them.
- IPS detects and blocks attacks.
- VPN encrypts network communication.
- Proxy servers hide users and filter traffic.
- WAF protects web applications.
- SIEM collects and analyzes security logs.
- Multiple security devices provide stronger protection than relying on just one.
