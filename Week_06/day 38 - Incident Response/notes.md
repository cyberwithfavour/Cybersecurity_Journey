# Day 38 – Incident Response

## Objective

Understand the Incident Response (IR) process, its phases, and how organizations detect, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from security incidents.

---

# What is Incident Response?

Incident Response (IR) is a structured process used to identify, manage, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.

The goal is to:

- Minimize damage
- Restore operations quickly
- Preserve evidence
- Prevent future incidents

Examples of incidents:

- Malware infection
- Data breach
- Ransomware attack
- Phishing attack
- Insider threat
- Denial of Service (DoS)

---

# Why Incident Response is Important

Without an Incident Response Plan:

- Attacks last longer.
- Damage increases.
- Data loss becomes more severe.
- Recovery takes longer.

A well-prepared organization responds faster and reduces business impact.

---

# Incident Response Lifecycle

According to NIST, Incident Response has six phases.

---

## 1. Preparation

Preparation happens before an incident occurs.

Activities include:

- Creating an Incident Response Plan
- Employee security awareness training
- Backups
- Installing security tools
- Defining roles and responsibilities
- Establishing communication procedures

Good preparation leads to faster response.

---

## 2. Detection and Analysis

The organization identifies suspicious activity and determines whether an incident has occurred.

Sources of detection:

- SIEM alerts
- IDS/IPS
- Antivirus alerts
- User reports
- Firewall logs
- Threat intelligence

Analysts determine:

- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- Which systems are affected?
- How severe is it?

---

## 3. Containment

Containment prevents the incident from spreading.

Examples:

- Disconnect infected computers
- Disable compromised accounts
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Isolate infected systems

Containment may be:

Short-term

Immediate actions to stop the attack.

Long-term

Temporary fixes while preparing permanent solutions.

---

## 4. Eradication

Remove the cause of the incident.

Examples:

- Delete malware
- Remove attacker accounts
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Reconfigure systems
- Change passwords

The goal is to eliminate the threat completely.

---

## 5. Recovery

Restore systems to normal operation.

Activities:

- Restore backups
- Verify systems are clean
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Return systems to production

Recovery should be gradual to ensure attackers no longer have access.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned

After recovery, the organization reviews the incident.

Questions include:

- What happened?
- Why did it happen?
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- How can future incidents be prevented?

Lessons learned improve future Incident Response efforts.

---

# Incident Response Plan (IRP)

An Incident Response Plan documents how the organization handles security incidents.

It defines:

- Roles
- Responsibilities
- Escalation procedures
- Communication methods
- Response steps

Every organization should maintain and regularly test its IRP.

---

# Chain of Custody

Chain of Custody documents who handled digital evidence from collection to presentation.

It ensures:

- Evidence integrity
- Evidence authenticity
- Legal admissibility

This is especially important during forensic investigations.

---

# Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

IoCs are pieces of evidence suggesting a system has been compromised.

Examples:

- Unknown processes
- Suspicious IP addresses
- Malware hashes
- Unusual login activity
- Unexpected network traffic

IoCs help analysts detect attacks.

---

# Indicators of Attack (IoAs)

IoAs focus on attacker behavior rather than evidence left behind.

Examples:

- Lateral movement
- Privilege escalation
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual PowerShell commands

IoAs help identify attacks while they are happening.

---

# Why Incident Response Matters

Cyberattacks cannot always be prevented.

Organizations that respond quickly experience:

- Less downtime
- Reduced financial loss
- Better protection of sensitive data
- Faster recovery
