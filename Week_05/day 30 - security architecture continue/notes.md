# Day 30 – Resilience, Redundancy, Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

## Objective

Understand how organizations prepare for disasters, maintain operations during disruptions, and recover quickly from incidents.

---

# What is Resilience?

Resilience is the ability of a system or organization to continue operating during and after an attack, failure, or disaster.

A resilient organization can:
- Detect problems.
- Respond quickly.
- Recover efficiently.
- Continue delivering critical services.

---

# What is Redundancy?

Redundancy means having backup components available in case the primary component fails.

Examples:

- Backup power supply (UPS)
- Secondary Internet connection
- Backup server
- Redundant hard drives (RAID)

Benefits:
- Improves availability.
- Reduces downtime.
- Eliminates single points of failure.

---

# Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

A Single Point of Failure is any component whose failure causes the entire system to stop working.

Example:

One server hosts the company website.

If the server fails:

The website becomes unavailable.

Solution:

Introduce redundancy.

---

# High Availability (HA)

High Availability (HA) ensures systems remain operational with minimal downtime.

Common techniques:

- Failover clustering
- Load balancing
- Redundant servers

Goal:

99.9% or higher availability.

---

# Load Balancing

A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

Example:

User Requests

↓

Load Balancer

↓

Server A

Server B

Server C

Benefits:

- Prevents overload.
- Improves performance.
- Supports High Availability.

---

# Failover

Failover automatically switches operations to a backup system when the primary system fails.

Example:

Primary database crashes.

↓

Backup database immediately becomes active.

Benefits:

- Minimal downtime.
- Improved resilience.

---

# Backup

A backup is a copy of important data stored separately from the original.

Purpose:

Restore data after:
- Hardware failure
- Accidental deletion
- Malware
- Ransomware
- Natural disasters

---

# Types of Backups

## Full Backup

Copies all data.

Advantages:
- Fast restoration.

Disadvantages:
- Takes more time.
- Requires more storage.

---

## Incremental Backup

Copies only data changed since the last backup.

Advantages:
- Faster backups.
- Saves storage.

Disadvantages:
- Restoration may take longer.

---

## Differential Backup

Copies all changes since the last full backup.

Advantages:
- Faster restoration than incremental.

Disadvantages:
- Larger backup size over time.

---

# Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

A Business Continuity Plan explains how an organization continues operating during disruptions.

Focus:

Keeping critical business functions running.

Examples:

- Employees work remotely.
- Backup office locations.
- Emergency communication plans.

---

# Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

A Disaster Recovery Plan focuses on restoring IT systems after a disaster.

Examples:

- Restore servers.
- Recover databases.
- Rebuild networks.
- Recover backups.

BCP keeps the business running.

DRP restores technology.

---

# Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

RTO is the maximum acceptable time a system can remain unavailable.

Example:

The payroll system must be restored within:

4 hours.

---

# Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss.

Example:

The company can only afford to lose:

15 minutes of data.

---

# Cold Site

An empty facility with basic infrastructure.

Advantages:
- Low cost.

Disadvantages:
- Long recovery time.

---

# Warm Site

Partially equipped backup facility.

Advantages:
- Moderate recovery time.

---

# Hot Site

Fully operational backup location.

Advantages:
- Fastest recovery.

Disadvantages:
- Highest cost.

---

# Why Resilience Matters

Cyber attacks, hardware failures, power outages, and natural disasters happen.

Organizations prepare using:

- Backups
- Redundancy
- High Availability
- Business Continuity
- Disaster Recovery

These reduce downtime and financial losses.

---
