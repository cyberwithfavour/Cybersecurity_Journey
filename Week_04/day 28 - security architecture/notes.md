# Day 28 – Virtualization, Containers & Cloud Computing

## Objective

Understand virtualization, virtual machines, containers, cloud computing models, and their security considerations.

---

# What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computing resources instead of using physical hardware directly.

One physical computer can run multiple independent operating systems.

Example:

One laptop can simultaneously run:
- Windows
- Ubuntu Linux
- Kali Linux

using virtualization software.

Benefits:
- Saves hardware costs.
- Improves resource utilization.
- Simplifies testing.
- Increases flexibility.

---

# Hypervisor

A Hypervisor is software that creates and manages Virtual Machines (VMs).

It allocates:
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage
- Network resources

to each VM.

Examples:
- VMware ESXi
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Oracle VirtualBox

---

# Types of Hypervisors

## Type 1 (Bare Metal)

Installed directly on physical hardware.

Examples:
- VMware ESXi
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Xen

Advantages:
- High performance
- More secure
- Used in data centers

---

## Type 2 (Hosted)

Installed on top of an existing operating system.

Examples:
- VirtualBox
- VMware Workstation

Advantages:
- Easy to install
- Great for learning and testing

---

# Virtual Machine (VM)

A Virtual Machine is a software-based computer.

Each VM has:
- Operating System
- CPU
- Memory
- Storage
- Applications

Each VM operates independently.

---

# Snapshots

A Snapshot captures the current state of a virtual machine.

Benefits:
- Roll back after mistakes.
- Restore after failed updates.
- Test software safely.

---

# What are Containers?

Containers package an application together with everything it needs to run.

Unlike Virtual Machines:

Containers share the host operating system.

Examples:
- Docker
- Podman

Benefits:
- Lightweight
- Faster startup
- Efficient resource usage

---

# Virtual Machines vs Containers

Virtual Machines

- Include their own operating system.
- Use more resources.
- Better isolation.

Containers

- Share the host OS.
- Lightweight.
- Faster deployment.

---

# Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the Internet.

Examples:
- Storage
- Servers
- Databases
- Networking
- Applications

Popular providers:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

---

# Cloud Service Models

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Provider supplies:
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

Customer manages:
- Operating system
- Applications

Example:
Amazon EC2

---

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Provider manages:
- Hardware
- Operating system
- Runtime

Customer manages:
- Applications
- Data

Example:
Google App Engine

---

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

Provider manages everything.

Users simply access the application.

Examples:
- Gmail
- Microsoft 365
- Dropbox

---

# Cloud Deployment Models

## Public Cloud

Shared cloud infrastructure available over the Internet.

Example:
AWS

Advantages:
- Low cost
- Highly scalable

---

## Private Cloud

Cloud infrastructure dedicated to one organization.

Advantages:
- More control
- Higher security

---

## Hybrid Cloud

Combination of public and private cloud.

Allows organizations to choose where workloads run.

---

## Community Cloud

Shared by organizations with similar security or compliance needs.

Example:
Government agencies sharing infrastructure.

---

# Cloud Security Considerations

Organizations should secure cloud environments using:

- MFA
- Encryption
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Logging and Monitoring
- Backup and Disaster Recovery

---

# Why Virtualization & Cloud Matter

Modern organizations rely heavily on:

- Cloud computing
- Virtual machines
- Containers

Cybersecurity professionals must understand how to secure these technologies.

---
